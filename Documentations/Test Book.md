# Test Plan – EasySave WPF

## Introduction

This test plan aims to validate the features and user interface of the EasySave application in its WPF (Graphical User Interface) version. Each test describes the necessary steps to verify a specific feature and the expected results. EasySave allows users to create and manage file backup jobs đơn giản, hiệu quả, and intuitively.

## 1. User Interface and Localization Tests

Jobs "MultiX" and "MultiY" are executed (sequentially or in parallel, depending on implementation).<br>2. Their respective states are updated during and after execution.<br>3. Both jobs ideally complete with "Completed successfully".                                                                                                                                 |
